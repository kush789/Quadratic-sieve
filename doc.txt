mp_limb_t smoothness_bound(mp_limb_t n)

	This function returns the smoothness B which is to be used in the
	sieve. The numbers will be checked for B smoothness based on this
	value.

	It is calculated as follows

	B = e ^ ((0.5)*((ln(n))*(ln(ln(n))))^0.5)

mp_limb_t* get_primes(mp_limb_t upper_bound, mp_limb_t* num)

	This function returns a pointer to an array of prime numbers lesser
	than or equal to the upper_bound supplied. It uses a cached prime
	table as we know that the upper bound cannot exceed 650, i.e. the 
	maximum smoothness value for a 64 bit integer.
